f5d9b479-2d49-473f-a97e-a2fd960d252b	Unlocking the science of E Ink displays: Why we believe they must catch on	"With their crisp, paper-like screens, e-readers like the Kindle are a pleasure to read on. But how do these E Ink displays actually work, and what makes them different from your phone or laptop screen? We unlock the science behind these ingenious displays and explore why E Ink still hasn’t conquered all our screens despite its advantages.
What are E Ink displays and how do they work?
E Ink displays are a special type of screen technology often used in e-readers like the Amazon Kindle. The technology was originally developed in the 1990s at MIT and is now owned by E Ink Corporation.
The screens work using tiny microcapsules filled with positively charged white particles and negatively charged black ones suspended in fluid inside the display. By applying positive or negative electrical charges to different areas of the screen, the white or black particles can be made to rise to the surface, creating the text and images on the display.

Unlike LCD and LED displays that use a backlight, E Ink displays reflect light – just like paper. This makes them easier on the eyes for long reading sessions. They also require very little power since they don’t need a backlight and only use energy when the image changes. The lack of backlighting also means that they are easier to read under brighter lighting conditions, which isn’t the case with LCD/LED displays at all – legibility actually takes a hit under bright sunlight.
How is E Ink different from E Paper?
E Ink and E Paper may sound like the same thing, but they actually refer to different display technologies. E Paper is a broad term for any display designed to mimic the appearance of real paper. Meanwhile, E Ink is a specific type of E Paper display that uses millions of tiny microcapsules filled with positively charged white particles and negatively charged black particles suspended in a clear fluid.

An excellent example of a device with an E Paper display but not an E Ink display is the Pebble smartwatch. This cool gadget uses a low-power LCD with a reflective layer to look like paper, which is a very different implementation from E Ink.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of E Ink displays?
E Ink displays have several key advantages that make them well-suited for certain applications. First, they consume very little power compared to LCD and OLED displays. An E Ink display only draws power when the image is changed, meaning it can display a static image for weeks or months without needing a charge. This makes it ideal for e-readers and other devices meant for long battery life.

Second, E Ink displays cause less eye strain for the user. The lack of a backlight and the paper-like visual experience mean users can read on an E Ink device for hours without fatigue. The matte surface and high contrast also make them easily readable outdoors and under bright light.

However, E Ink displays also have some downsides. The biggest is their slow refresh rate compared to LCD and OLED displays. While improvements have been made, such Ink displays still take much longer to refresh, making them unsuitable for video or animation. E Ink also has limitations on colour and resolution compared to other display technologies. And the niche nature of E Ink manufacturing means the displays remain expensive, especially in larger sizes. This limits their use to mostly e-readers and a handful of other products where their particular advantages outweigh higher cost.
Therefore, for the majority of display applications demanding speed, responsiveness and high resolution, LCDs and OLEDs remain superior to E Ink alternatives. But for a subset of use cases valuing long battery life, outdoor visibility and eye comfort, they retain unique benefits over other display tech.
What are the uses of E Ink displays?
E Ink first hit the scene in the early 2000s and was all the rage among e-readers like the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and Sony Reader. Folks loved it because the text was super clear even in bright sunlight. You can still find E Ink displays on Kindle and Kobo e-readers today, though other screen tech has taken over much of the e-reader market.

E Ink made brief appearances in a few early cell phones before getting replaced by fancier displays. But with its easy reading and lower distraction factor, some startups are exploring E Ink in smartphones. A cool example is the BlackBerry-like Minimal Phone, currently crowdfunding, which aims to cut down screen time and help users focus on communication and productivity.

Beyond mobile devices, E Ink is popping up around a few cities on stuff like bus stop displays and walking direction signs. Some restaurants are using E Ink menu boards too. Unlike glossy LCDs that create glare and reflections, such displays feature a matte surface that’s more natural-looking and readable at angles and under different lighting."

Leaks suggest larger 8″ screen for next-gen console	"Rumours are heating up that Nintendo may unveil a successor to its popular Switch console later this year. According to a new prediction by Omdia analyst Hiroshi Hayase, the so-called “Nintendo Switch 2” could launch in 2024 with an 8-inch LCD screen, representing a sizable increase over the 6.2-inch and 7-inch displays found on the original Switch and Switch OLED models respectively.
Hayase based his forecast on supply chain research focused on small and medium sized displays. He believes demand from Nintendo for larger screens suitable for a Switch successor will cause shipments of amusement displays to double next year.
Neither Nintendo nor its partners have officially confirmed the existence of a Switch 2. However, Bloomberg has reported that Hayase is not alone in predicting an upgraded Nintendo console to hit shelves in 2024.
Speculation around a new Nintendo platform has swirled for many months, with signs pointing to its unveiling this year. There are reports that Nintendo privately showcased the Switch 2 to developers at Gamescom 2023.
Details on the Switch 2’s technical specifications remain uncertain and conflicting. Some leaks point to a new Nvidia Tegra processor, while others expect Nintendo to use an 8nm chipset from Samsung rather than a 5nm node.
The Switch 2 is expected to support 4K visuals and run at 60 frames per second, a significant boost over the original Switch’s max 1080p resolution and 30 frames per second target. Breath of the Wild 2 and tech demos based on Unreal Engine 5 are rumoured to have already been tested on prototype Switch 2 developer hardware.
Of course, fans eagerly awaiting the next generation of Nintendo gaming will have to wait for official word direct from Nintendo before getting too excited. But analysts clearly believe the company is poised to capitalise on the original Switch’s success with new hardware in 2024."

Not only is the company enabling alternate browser engines on iOS for the first time ever, but Epic Games has also announced the eventual return of Fortnite to the platform.
Epic Games revealed it plans to launch the Epic Games Store on iOS devices and bring Fortnite back to the platform later this year, but only in Europe. Fortnite has been unavailable on iOS since 2020 when it was banned for violating App Store policies around in-app purchases.
The return of Fortnite marks a major shift for Apple’s traditionally closed ecosystem. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney described Apple’s new rules allowing third-party app stores as “hot garbage” but said the company will take advantage of them regardless.
The rules stem from the EU’s Digital Markets Act intended to rein in anti-competitive behavior from major tech companies like Apple. Part of the regulations require that users have the ability to uninstall pre-installed apps like Safari.
Complementing this change, iOS 17.4 will for the first time allow alternate browser engines beyond just Apple’s own WebKit. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge have historically been forced to run on WebKit for iOS due to Apple’s restrictions.
Now, with iOS 17.4 which rolls out next month, developers can apply to use alternate engines like Chromium and Gecko. This will enable full functionality and extension support for third-party browsers available on iOS in Europe.
Both these developments represent a blow to the walls of Apple’s walled garden. While falling short of fully opening iOS, they demonstrate Apple bending its strict App Store policies in order to comply with the DMA.
ADVERTISEMENT
The DMA aims to give users more choice over their devices and create a more level playing field between Apple and small developers. Epic Games’ Tim Sweeney said these goals are undermined by the restrictions Apple still has in place like its commission on in-app purchases.
Nonetheless, the return of Fortnite and availability of alternate browsers are milestones in increased competition on iOS. It remains to be seen whether Apple will expand these allowances globally in the face of similar regulatory pressure elsewhere. For now, European iOS users will enjoy options long desired but forbidden by Apple’s tight control over its ecosystem."	
2590bd60-fc6f-42a5-a2a9-501cd20ed026	Hubble finds water vapour on small exoplanet in landmark discovery	"Astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to find evidence of water vapour in the atmosphere of the planet GJ 9827d. Even though the planet is twice as wide as the Earth, it is the smallest exoplanet where astronomers have found evidence of water so far.
The Max Planck Institute for Astronomy announced the discovery on Thursday. “This would be the first time that we can directly show through atmospheric detection, that these planets with water-rich atmospheres can actually exist around other stars. This is an important step toward determining the prevalence and diversity of atmospheres on rocky planets,” said research team member Björn Benneke in a press statement.
But before you jump the gun and imagine the possibility of life on the planet, do note that it is as hot as Venus, which will make a Delhi summer pale in comparison. What is important about the discovery is that the aging Hubble was used to determine the presence of water on such a (relatively) small exoplanet, opening up many new avenues for scientists.
But on the other hand, it is still too early for the scientists to conclude whether Hubble measured a small amount of water vapour on a planet with a puffy hydrogen-rick atmosphere or if the atmosphere itself is mostly made of water that was left behind a primeval hydrogen/helium atmosphere that evaporated in the intense radiation of a star.
But since the planet is around six billion years old and so close to its host star, scientists are leaning towards the latter possibility since it should have lost most of its primordial hydrogen due to stellar radiation.
In the end, the research team is left with two possibilities — either the planet is still clinging to its hydrogen-rich atmosphere, which will make it a mini-Neptune; or it is a warmer version of Jupiter’s moon Europa, which has twice as much water as our planet under its crust."

The nebula is in the H II region of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and was captured by Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).
N79 is simply a humongous star-forming celestial region that spans around 1,630 light-years and is in the southwest region of LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). It is regarded as the younger version of the Tarantula Nebula (officially known as 30 Doradus). However, scientists estimate that N79 has a star formation efficiency that far exceeds the Tarantula Nebula.
This image, in particular, focuses on one of three giant molecular clouds complex called N79 South or S1. The star-shaped pattern that you can see here is a series of diffraction spikes. Just like most other telescopes, Webb uses a mirror to collect light. The design of the mirror on the telescope causes this artifact.
The six largest “star spikes” that you can see in the image are caused by the hexagonal symmetry of the Webb telescope’s 18 primary mirror segments. These sorts of patterns are usually most visible around very bright and compact objects where a lot of light comes from the same place. Even though most galaxies appear very small to our eyes, they are much more spread out than a single star and thus do not cause this pattern.
This particular image centres on one of the three giant molecular cloud complexes, dubbed N79 South (S1 for short). The distinct ‘starburst’ pattern surrounding this bright object is a series of diffraction spikes. All telescopes that use a mirror to collect light, as Webb does, have this form of artifact that arises from the design of the telescope. In Webb’s case, the six largest starburst spikes appear because of the hexagonal symmetry of Webb’s 18 primary mirror segments. Patterns like these are only noticeable around very bright, compact objects, where all the light comes from the same place. Most galaxies, even though they appear very small to our eyes, are darker and more spread out than a single star, and therefore do not show this pattern."

The changes include lower pricing for its popular GPT-3.5 Turbo model, a performance boost for GPT-4 Turbo, and upgraded text embedding models.
Most notably, OpenAI has cut the per-token pricing of GPT-3.5 Turbo by 50% for input and 25% for output. This model powers applications like ChatGPT and serves as an industry benchmark for conversational AI. Lower prices make the API more accessible for developers building text-intensive products that require analysing documents or books. With open-source models catching up to OpenAI, reduced pricing helps retain customers.
GPT-3.5 Turbo also gains a new version 0125 with unspecified “improvements.” Since the last iteration was 0613, some may have expected more details on advancements from OpenAI.
For GPT-4 Turbo, a new preview model 0125 arrives that OpenAI says “completes tasks like code generation more thoroughly” to reduce “laziness” where the model avoids finishing work. This fix aims to boost performance on technical tasks compared to previous versions. GPT-4 with vision capabilities remains in preview but will launch more broadly in coming months.
On the technical side, upgraded text embedding models provide better semantic representations of language for researchers and engineers.
While not earth-shattering, OpenAI’s latest tweaks reflect the company’s iterative approach to enhancing its AI lineup."

It was originally designed as a technology demonstration to complete five test flights over 30 days but it far exceeded that expectation by completing 72 flights over a period of three years.
“The historic journey of Ingenuity, the first aircraft on another planet, has come to end. That remarkable helicopter flew higher and farther than we ever imagined and helped NASA do what we do best – make the impossible possible. Through missions like Ingenuity, NASA is paving the way for future flight in our solar system and smarter, safer human exploration to Mars and beyond,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in a press statement.
The rotorcraft landed on Mars on February 18, 2021, secured within the Perseverance rover. It took off on its first flight on April 19 that year, marking the first time that any aircraft achieved powered controlled flight on a world other than Earth. It dispatched its next four flights quickly as well, completing its original mission. After that, NASA engineers began using Ingenuity as an aerial scout for the Perseverance rover.
Fast forward to 2024, the Ingenuity team at the space agency was planning to make a short vertical hop on January 18 to determine its exact location after an emergency landing during a previous flight. Telemetry data showed that it achieved its maximum altitude of 12 metres and hovered for 4.5 seconds before it started descending with a velocity of about one metre per second.
But once the helicopter was about a metre above the surface, it lost contact with Perseverance. Since Perseverance acts as a communication relay between the helicopter and Earth, this meant that mission controllers lost touch with the rotorcraft. Communications were reestablished the following day.
Images of Ingenuity taken by Perseverance reveal revealed the damage to the rotorblade but the reason for the communication dropouts and the orientation of the rotorcraft at the time of touchdown are still being investigated to find out exactly what happened."

36c9d57e-b3aa-4227-b6d2-8e94a555445b	Google introduces Lumiere, a multimodal AI video model: Is this the future of filmmaking?	"Google just announced its latest AI video model that is capable of creating realistic, diverse, and coherent motion. Known as Lumiere, the latest offering from Google is a text-to-video and image-to-video model. In simple words, you input text or image and the AI neural networks translate it into a video. Based on recent reports, Lumiere is much beyond the simple text-to-video functionality.
The tool allows users to animate existing images, and create videos in the format of an input image or painting. It also allows video in painting and creating specific animation in sections within an image.
How does Lumiere create videos?
Google’s research titled ‘Lumiere: A Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation’ offers the scientific details behind Lumiere. “We introduce Lumiere – a text-to-video diffusion model designed for synthesizing videos that portray realistic, diverse, and coherent motion – a pivotal challenge in video synthesis. To this end, we introduce a Space-Time U-Net architecture that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once, through a single pass in the model,” reads the opening lines of the abstract.
ICYMI | Best AI tools of 2023: ChatGPT rules the roost, followed by Google Bard, Midjourney, and more
The main innovation here is the SpaceTime Diffusion model that generates the entire temporal duration of the video at once. In contrast, existing AI video models synthesize distant key frames one at a time. With Lumiere, Google aims to offer global temporal consistency ensuring coherent representation across different frames.
In the research paper, the capabilities of Lumiere have been demonstrated through various examples. Based on the output, the text-to-video results show some promising consistency and accuracy in portraying diverse scenes. Meanwhile, the image-to-video transformations too seem to show impressive animations. Further, the model’s stylised generation using reference images also produces visually appealing and coherent results.
Lumiere text-to-video demo as cited in the research paper.
According to the researchers, the text-to-video generation framework has been introduced using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion. Since existing methods were struggling with globally coherent motion, the team addressed this by deploying a space-time U-Net architecture that directly generates full-frame-rate video clips, incorporating spatial and temporal modules. Resultantly, their approach showed superior results in image-to-video, video inpainting, and stylised generation.

Why does it matter?
In the paper, the team compares the performance of the AI model with other state-of-the-art models in the industry that are known for their superior performance in text-to-video and image-to-video generation. Based on the results, Lumiere seems to outperform in terms of video quality as well as text alignment.
While this model may create a buzz with its incredible capabilities, its potential use case could essentially be enabling individuals to create Hollywood-style slick movies with ease. The AI community has been exploring how these models could generate images and videos and the development of world models for advanced simulations. Lumiere seems to be paving way for more advancements and research. It is a significant leap in AI-driven video synthesis, offering vast creative possibilities. The consistent and realistic results displayed in the examples indicate the potential for transformative advancements in the field of AI-generated content.
In conclusion, the team stated that their primary goal in this work is to enable novice users to generate visual content creatively and flexibly.

Tech giant Microsoft is the latest to announce layoffs, the company is reportedly sacking around 1,900 people from its gaming division. According to a memo accessed by CNBC, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said that the layoffs were intended to minimise areas of overlap. The gaming division had a strength of 22,000.
In the memo, Spencer has been reported to describe the layoffs as painful. He went on to say that those directly impacted by these reductions have all played an important part in the success of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and the Xbox teams. He added that they should all be proud of everything that they have accomplished in the Gaming division.
The CEO also said that the company is planning to invest in areas that will grow the business and support its strategy of bringing more games to more players around the world. Incidentally, the latest development comes after Microsoft closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard known for titles such as ‘World of Warcraft’, ‘Call of Duty’, ‘Spyro’, etc.

Spencer, while acknowledging the contribution of the team members, also assured that they will be offered full support during the transition including severance benefits as informed by local employment laws. He added that the roles that will be impacted will be notified. Spencer also urged the teams to treat their departing colleagues with respect and compassion, something which according to him has been consistent with the brand’s values.
Meanwhile, as part of the layoffs, Mike Ybarra, president of Blizzard Entertainment announced his departure from the company. Ybarra joined Blizzard in 2019. “To the incredible teams at Blizzard – thank you. Words can’t express how I feel about all of you. You are amazing. Continue to do incredible things and always keep Blizzard blue and the player at the forefront of every decision,” Ybarra said in his long post on X.

Meanwhile, Blizzard’s chief design officer co-founder Allen Adham is also developing. Reportedly, Microsoft’s gaming teams have already been marred by significant cuts in budgets even before the layoffs took place.
The gaming segment has had several layoffs in the last few weeks. Earlier, this week, Riot Games was reported to have laid off 530 employees and shut down its publishing arm Riot Forge. Earlier this month, Lost Boys Interactive, a Gearbox-owned video game developer with 400 employees fired a sizable portion of the company."

d43f556a-7cb2-4972-8cc8-9b839a8173bb	What is Apple’s new ‘Stolen Device Protection’ for iPhones and how to turn it on	"Apple has released iOS 17.3, the latest version of its mobile operating system for iPhones. One of the key new features is ‘Stolen Device Protection’, which adds extra security measures to protect users’ data if their phone gets stolen. This should be high on every iPhone user’s list to enable, as it better protects your information without any effort on your part.
When you turn on Stolen Device Protection, your iPhone will put limits on certain settings changes when it’s not in a familiar location like your home or workplace. If a thief unlocks your phone and tries to alter these settings, they’ll be required to authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID first. So even if they have your passcode, they can’t modify protected settings without also duplicating your biometrics – a near-impossible task."	
94f517a6-f3a2-4f3a-a783-da288e1dfac8	Meta moves to protect teens from unwanted messages on Instagram, Facebook	"Meta Platforms is building more safeguards to protect teen users from unwanted direct messages on Instagram and Facebook, the social media platform said on Thursday.
The move comes weeks after the WhatsApp owner said it would hide more content from teens after regulators pushed the world’s most popular social media network to protect children from harmful content on its apps.
The regulatory scrutiny increased following testimony in the U.S. Senate by a former Meta employee who alleged the company was aware of harassment and other harm facing teens on its platforms but failed to act against them.
Meta said teens will no longer get direct messages from anyone they do not follow or are not connected to on Instagram by default. They will also require parental approval to change certain settings on the app.
On Messenger, accounts of users under 16 and below 18 in some countries will only receive messages from Facebook friends or people they are connected through phone contacts.
Adults over the age of 19 cannot message teens who don’t follow them, Meta added."

0909e864-e405-49e6-93d3-64208344f080	Bill Gates is excited about rapidly advancing robotics, says it won’t be taking all jobs	"Robotics is the next frontier in technology. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence in recent times have accelerated the integration and deployment of AI. Numerous companies around the world have integrated AI into their robots that have been developed for various use cases. Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, who is a vocal proponent of AI, took to his blog to share his thoughts about the advancements in robotics technology.
In his post, Gates expressed his excitement about the rapid progress in robotics technology and the potential for robots to transform how we live and work. While the billionaire outlined some limitations, he also stated that the innovations in AI are enabling them to demonstrate human-like capabilities in domains such as learning, understanding, and thinking.
The 68-year-old believes that robots can undertake dangerous and unfulfilling jobs, making people safer, healthier, and more productive. He went on to highlight some of the robotics companies that are at the forefront of developing humanoid robots that can seamlessly interact with humans. He also sees the possibility for robots to be active in healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing, and even in homes in the future.
On robots taking jobs
Gates acknowledged the fear of robots taking over jobs; however, he feels that governments and the private sector will need to help people brave this transition.

“I understand concerns about robots taking people’s jobs, an unfortunate consequence of almost every new innovation—including the internet, which (for example) turned everyone into a travel agent and eliminated much of the vacation-planning industry. If robots have a similar impact on employment, governments and the private sector will have to help people navigate the transition,” he wrote.
The billionaire said that considering the shortages in the economy and the dangerous and unrewarding nature of certain jobs, robots are unlikely to take jobs that we love, and more likely, they will take over jobs that people are unwilling to do. “I believe it’s less likely that robots will replace us in jobs we love and more likely that they’ll do work people don’t want to be doing. In the process, they can make us safer, healthier, more productive, and even less lonely.”
The limitless possibilities
When it comes to robotics, Gates feels if the technology is used the right way, there would be limitless use cases. According to Gates, robots can help during natural disasters where first responders would have to risk their lives or during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic when human interactions may spread the disease further. Robotics can help in manually pulling out weeds from farms instead of toxic chemical herbicides. They can also help move massive loads on factory floors. They can also be beneficial in prosthetics.

Gates went on to list some of the robotics companies that are doing something remarkable. In Agriculture, Tevel’s fruit-picking robots can work round the clock to address labour shortages and prevent crop wastage. Similarly, Apptronik is developing general-purpose humanoid robots that can be programmed to do various tasks. UCLA’s RoMeLa lab has developed ARTEMIS, one of the world’s fastest-running robots. Startups like Field AI are focused on developing AI software to improve robots’ perception, navigation, and communication abilities.
Gates, who frequently shares his thoughts on AI, had, in a recent interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, said that generative AI had plateaued and that GPT-5 will not be much different. In the same interview, the Microsoft co-founder also predicted that in the next two to five years, the accuracy of AI software will witness a considerable increase along with a cost reduction. This will lead to the creation of new and reliable applications."

5b0a5068-3fb7-4706-ba2a-aa5032eb15da	The Minimal Phone channels BlackBerry vibes with keyboard and E Ink display	"The smartphone world is dominated by big, colourful touchscreen devices like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy. But a new crowdfunded phone called the Minimal Phone is going back to basics with a throwback design featuring a physical keyboard and black and white E Ink display.
Minimal Phone is the creation of Minimal Company, which plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign in early February to manufacture at least 3,000 units. The company says the phone’s final design is complete and aims to ship the device later this year if funding goals are met.
This isn’t your typical smartphone. Instead of a bright LCD or OLED screen, Minimal Phone uses a power-friendly monochrome E Ink display like you’d find on an e-reader. This provides easy outdoor readability and uses less electricity, allowing the phone’s 4,000 mAh battery to last up to 4 days on a charge according to Minimal Company.

The tradeoff is that an E Ink display isn’t ideal for video or motion-heavy games. It’s not like you’ll not be able to play those at all, but the display technology is definitely not suited for such use. However, for those looking to minimize distractions and focus on communication and productivity probably wouldn’t need support for it anyway. The Minimal Phone is meant to offer digital detox while still providing smartphone capabilities, after all.
Despite the minimalist aesthetic, founder Andre Youkhana says the phone will have modern features like a touch-enabled E Ink screen, camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, global cellular connectivity, and Android OS with Google Play support. The company is also exploring 5G capabilities.
At 120 x 72 x 10mm, the phone has a compact form factor reminiscent of older BlackBerry designs thanks to its full QWERTY keyboard. This physical keyboard complements the E Ink display for efficient typing and messaging.
Minimal Phone’s pared-down MinimalOS comes preloaded with a curated set of apps focused on productivity and privacy. With prices starting around $400 (Rs 33,250), it aims to provide core smartphone functionality at an affordable price point for the niche audience seeking a simpler mobile experience.

That said, the Kickstarter launch will determine if there’s enough interest to put the Minimal Phone into production. There’s even a chance it may never go into production at all if the funding needs aren’t met or an unexpected snag gets in the way – but we’re hoping it all goes smoothly."

c30b27e4-074a-42ae-b7f6-9b3a5d367be3	NASA, Boeing plan to send astronauts on Starliner spacecraft this April	"After years of delays, NASA said on Wednesday it is planning to launch two astronauts to the International Space Station on a Boeing Starliner spacecraft no earlier than mid-April.
The space agency says significant progress has been made in resolving technical issues that were identified during the spacecraft’s flight certification process. Starliner went through a successful drop test earlier this month. Teams from NASA and Boeing are conducting the final analysis of the data to complete overall system certification ahead of its first crewed flight.
NASA selected both Boeing and SpaceX in 2014 to develop crew transport systems to carry astronauts into space. Boeing was awarded a $4.2 billion contract, while SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion. Elon Musk-led SpaceX completed its first crewed flight in 2020, and it has carried more than a dozen crewed flights to the space station since then, along with many cargo flights. Boeing, meanwhile, has only completed two uncrewed flight tests of Starliner.
In the background, Boeing completed the removal of over seven kilograms of the P213 tape that could pose a fire risk in some conditions. In parts of the spacecraft where removing the tape could lead to other hardware issues, the company overwrapped the P213 tape with a different non-flammable, chafe-resistant tap and installed fire breaks on wire harnesses.
Major integrated flight operations exercises are also underway with mission support teams recently completed a two-day undocking to landing mission dress rehearsal at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico."

33b65ff6-6060-496c-88c9-9e093b46d131	Tesla will start making new EV model in second half of 2025	"Tesla expects to start production of its long-anticipated, next-generation electric vehicle at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday.
But Tesla shares were down 6.5% in premarket trading as Musk noted that ramping up production of the new vehicle would be challenging and Tesla also warned of sharp slowdown in sales growth this year before the new model launch. Musk said it would take “a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology” required – a sign that any boost to Tesla’s declining pace of growth would take time.
His projection followed a Reuters story earlier in the day saying Tesla had told suppliers to prepare for a June 2025 startup of a smaller crossover vehicle, critical for the automaker as it loses share to inexpensive EVs such as those made by China’s BYD.
“I’m often optimistic regarding time. But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025, sometime in the second half,” Musk told analysts on a post-earnings call.

“We’ll be sleeping on the line practically,” he said, referring to Tesla’s factory in Texas, where the new model will be first produced. That will be followed by Mexico and another factory outside North America to be decided later this year, he said.
The EV maker also warned of “notably lower” sales growth this year as it focuses on the new vehicle on the back of shrinking fourth-quarter gross margin.
Tesla said it was in between two growth waves: one driven by the release of Models 3 and Y in 2017 and 2020, respectively, and a second wave that would start with the next-generation vehicle platform.
ADVERTISEMENT
Wall Street expects Tesla to sell 2.2 million vehicles this year, according to Visible Alpha. That would be up about 21% from 2023 but well below the long-term target of 50% that Musk set about three years ago. Tesla, however, did not reiterate that target on Wednesday.
After years of breakneck growth, Tesla is bracing for slowing growth and margins as EV demand softens and competition intensifies.
“If volume’s going to be lower, then my guess is, Musk will probably cut prices and take share. Margins may continue to struggle for a while,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at shareholder Hodges Capital Management.
Cost of goods sold per vehicle declined sequentially in the fourth quarter, but Tesla cautioned it was approaching “the natural limit of cost down of our existing vehicle lineup,” underscoring the pressure on the company to launch its new lower-cost vehicles. BYD sold more EVs globally than Tesla in the fourth quarter.

Musk said Chinese automakers will have significant success outside of China. “If there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.”
Tesla reported a gross margin of 17.6% for the three months ended December, compared with 23.8% a year earlier, and analysts’ average estimate of 18.3%, according to LSEG data.
Automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits – a closely watched figure – dropped to 17.2% from 24.3% a year earlier, although it improved from 16.3% in the third quarter.
“Today’s flat sales and substantially reduced margin results are further evidence that Tesla is losing its leadership advantage and its brand leadership has weakened,” said Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand.

MORE PRICE CUTS?
Tesla slashed prices of its cars since late 2022, igniting a price war that singed U.S. rivals including Ford, who have all slowed EV production.
Musk said on Wednesday that Tesla’s margins will depend on how fast interest rates fall.
Its stock, which has enjoyed valuations of a technology company partly due to Musk’s promise of self-driving cars, has fallen 16% so far this year, after doubling in 2023
“I don’t think the price cuts are over, mainly for the reason that demand for its electric vehicles is still weak,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

Net income more than doubled from the previous year to $7.9 billion, including a $5.9 billion noncash gain related to deferred tax assets. Tesla said lower raw material costs and U.S. government credits helped lower cost-per-vehicle, but Cybertruck production and AI and other research projects increased costs.
On an adjusted basis, Tesla earned 71 cents per share in the fourth quarter, missing an average analysts’ estimate of 74 cents, according to LSEG data.
Tesla’s fourth-quarter revenue rose 3% to $25.17 billion, which marked its slowest pace of growth in more than three years. Analysts on average expected $25.62 billion, according to LSEG data."	
fe0b8209-86e4-4ce7-9d9e-b45bf52a13c5	Spotify to start in-app purchases on iPhone in Europe after DMA takes effect	"Spotify users in Europe can start to buy audiobooks and subscription plans from within the music-streaming app from March as a result of the region’s new competition law for Big Tech, the Swedish company said on Wednesday.
The move will help the company avoid Apple’s 30% fee for purchases through its App Store, which has long been a source of contention between app developers and the tech giant.
Spotify has for years been embroiled in a legal battle, alleging that it was forced to raise the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs tied to Apple’s App Store rules.
U.S.-listed shares of the Stockholm-based company rose around 2%.

“For years Apple had these rules where we couldn’t tell you about offers, how much something costs, or even where or how to buy it,” Spotify said in a blogpost.
“The DMA (Digital Markets Act) means that we’ll finally be able to share details about deals, promotions, and better-value payment options in the EU.”
Under the DMA, which all Big Tech firms must comply with by March 7, companies are obligated to treat their own products and services like they do rivals’.

Apple plans to challenge the European Union’s decision to put all of App Store into the bloc’s new digital antitrust list, Bloomberg News had reported in November.
On Tuesday, Apple asked a London tribunal to throw out a mass lawsuit worth around $1 billion brought on behalf of more than 1,500 app developers over its App Store rules.
Apple had also drawn criticism from Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg who called App Store policies and fee structure as problematic and causing a conflict of interest.
“We’ve always been interested in helping developers distribute their apps, and new options would add more competition in this space,” Meta said on Wednesday.

While projectors have been around for a while and predate the advent of mainstream television, the industry has undergone a lot of changes over the last few years, and the current projector market offers unique solutions catering to various use cases.
However, buying a projector is still a confusing process, especially considering the huge variety of projectors available in the market. Here is a simple guide on how to pick the right smart projector that fits your needs.

02210e04-d02c-49b6-8c4e-cb316cc1338e	Asus bets big on ‘AI PCs’ to drive growth in India	"The buzz around artificial intelligence PCs is growing louder by the day, thanks largely to Microsoft’s big push for these next-gen laptops and desktops. But what exactly are AI PCs and how critical will they be for the future of personal computing? According to Arnold Su, vice president of consumer and gaming PCs at Asus India, AI PCs are the new cutting edge but will become standard in the next 5-10 years.
“From a business perspective, what we are looking at AI PCs is similar to the evolution of smartphones 10-12 years ago. Back then, smartphones were treated as a novelty just like how AI PCs are viewed today. But now, nobody talks about smartphones anymore. They are just phones. Similarly, 5-10 years down the line, AI PCs will just become PCs with AI features being standard,” said Su.
Asus is already beginning to integrate basic AI capabilities into its laptop lineup. “What you have seen right now and you will see with our upcoming launches is, we have enhanced our camera technologies and we’ve also enhanced our noise cancellation capabilities. The integration of all these systems we have started in 2021 itself and now with the new chips and new applications building in, we will continue to enhance the customer experience from that. And going forward, you will have more stuff to look forward to,” noted Su.
The ‘AI PC’ trend was kicked off earlier this year by Microsoft, which introduced a dedicated ‘Copilot’ key on its PCs. Other brands are expected to follow suit. (Image: Microsoft)
However, Asus’ current AI integration focuses more on things like computer vision and audio processing rather than bleeding-edge generative AI abilities seen in models like ChatGPT. When asked if Asus has any specific plans to build proprietary generative AI tools, Su did not divulge much. “I can’t talk about future plans at the moment, but currently we are working with multiple partners and we look forward to what we can achieve internally and then we’ll bring the best stuff out for the customers,” he hinted.
While the PC market declined in 2022 due to macroeconomic conditions, Asus India managed to buck the trend and record strong growth. Su believes reaching customers across India through online and offline channels is key to Asus’ success.
“Because India is such a big country, making every product available is very important. So from the PC market point of view, there are three major verticals in India – online space, large format retailer, and the traditional channel. We make our products available through online platforms, large format retail stores as well as the traditional channel which still accounts for 50% of the market. We have partner shops in over 400 districts currently where customers can experience our laptops first-hand before buying. This experience is critical and sets us apart,” explained Su.
Asus now has over 250 exclusive stores across India covering 600 out of 750 districts. The goal is to expand to more towns and cities to stay the second-largest PC brand in India.

In Su’s words, “In Q3 2022, Asus became the number two consumer PC brand in India for the first time, overtaking HP. For 2023, we want to secure this second spot. We will continue focusing on bringing the latest tech across India’s towns and cities.”
This focus on India is not just lip service but core to Asus’ global market strategy. “India is always the first wave country for any new Asus product launch globally. It is our first priority within the company,” emphasised Su.
Contrary to the belief that entry-level devices drive volumes in India, Su has realised that Indian consumers are willing to spend more for better experiences.
“Over the years, we’ve seen Indian customers prefer mainstream and premium laptops over entry-level options. When they invest in a device, they want the satisfaction of having bought the latest tech that meets their needs, regardless of the price point,” he said.

Asus will continue to focus on bringing cutting-edge yet practical innovation to consumers across segments, without fixating on any particular form factor or specification.
“We launched gaming two-in-ones, dual screen, foldable, and handheld gaming PCs last year. There may not be one definitive laptop form factor in the future. As a PC innovator, we will keep bridging the gap between users’ needs and devices,” concluded Su on what customers can expect from Asus moving forward."

5859659d-7c65-4ed4-a95a-6f938022f30c	Watch: Asteroid burns up over Germany hours after it was discovered	"Early on Sunday morning, a tiny asteroid hurtled towards Earth, entered its atmosphere and exploded in a ball of fire above Nennhausen in Germany, west of Berlin. The asteroid was harmless, and researchers detected it three hours before impact.
Such asteroid entries usually happen a few times a year, but this one was special because it was detected before it hit, according to Live Science. This is only the eighth time that scientists have spotted one of these asteroids before it hit the planet’s atmosphere. “Heads Up: A tiny asteroid will disintegrate as a harmless fireball west of Berlin near Nennhausen shortly at 1:32 AM CET. Overseers will see it if it’s clear!,” shared NASA’s Asteroid Watch team on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday.
When the asteroid arrived, it was far from inconspicuous and social media was flooded with videos of the asteroid’s descent over Europe. Denis Vida, a PhD associate in meteor physics at Western University in Canada, shared this video of the asteroid that was captured by a camera livestreaming from the Augustusplatz square in the city of Germany.
Here’s the full video of the asteroid #Sar2736, a ~1 m object that broke up some 50 m west of #Belin, #Germany, and probably dropped some meteorites on the ground. Video credit: https://t.co/72o6ZzPNz8 pic.twitter.com/PA73dkqid1

Science journalist Robin George Andrews also shared a video of the asteroid without specifying the source. You can watch that below.

The sample container landed on Earth in September but two fasteners of the container were stuck, preventing the opening of the container.
But on January 10, NASA engineers were able to remove the two stuck fasteners that prevented the opening of the sample container. The container carries precious cargo — about 250 grams of material from the asteroid Bennu collected by the OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft about two years ago.

882917ed-25d3-454c-aa4c-733df8e7c01c	Apple Vision Pro buzz fizzles after launch weekend	"Apple’s highly anticipated Vision Pro virtual reality headset quickly sold out after preorders opened last Friday. But some concerning signs point to waning demand according to Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the top Apple analysts.
Kuo estimates Apple sold between 160,000 to 180,000 units over launch weekend based on shipping times increasing to 5-7 weeks within hours of the preorder opening. However, those lengthy delivery estimates remained unchanged 48 hours after preorders began. Kuo wrote this “raises a major concern” that demand could taper off rapidly after early adopters and tech enthusiasts placed their orders.
